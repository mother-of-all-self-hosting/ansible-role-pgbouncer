# PgBouncer Ansible role

✨👾 *This role is developed on [Radicle](https://radicle.dev), a peer-to-peer code collaboration stack built on Git.*

This is an [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) role which installs [PgBouncer](https://www.pgbouncer.org/) to run as a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container wrapped in a systemd service.

This role *implicitly* depends on:

- [`com.devture.ansible.role.playbook_help`](https://github.com/devture/com.devture.ansible.role.playbook_help)
- [`com.devture.ansible.role.systemd_docker_base`](https://github.com/devture/com.devture.ansible.role.systemd_docker_base)

Check [`defaults/main.yml`](defaults/main.yml) for the full list of supported options. Refer to [this page](docs/configuring-pgbouncer.md) for details about setting up the service with this role.

## Development

### Collaborating on Radicle

This role is developed and distributed on Radicle, and you can freely open an issue or a "patch" for updating it.

Please follow [this "Getting Started" guide](https://radicle.dev/guides/quick-start) on the official documentation for the basic installation and usage of the Radicle toolchain.

You can clone the repository by running the command below:

```sh
rad clone rad:z3oYuZkAzW85ZhAKZyb7Wv6AvTVox
```

💡 When you only want to "seed" a repository and have no interest in contributing code, you can still be a repository’s friend with the `rad seed` command. This is Radicle’s version of a ⭐ *star* or 👍 *like*, where you care by sharing it with others on the network.

### pre-commit

You can optionally install a Git pre-commit hook (via [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) + [prek](https://prek.j178.dev/)) that runs formatting and linting checks before each commit. See [`.pre-commit-config.yaml`](./.pre-commit-config.yaml) for which hooks are to be executed.

To install the hook, run the [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just) command below:

```sh
just prek-install-git-pre-commit-hook
```

### Molecule

This role supports [Molecule](https://docs.ansible.com/projects/molecule/), an Ansible testing framework designed for developing and testing Ansible collections, playbooks, and roles.

Refer to [this page](./molecule/README.md) for details about how to utilize it.
